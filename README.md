# Go Fish 

You met a special agent, and in order to extract information from him, you're going to play a game of go fish. Today we're going to implement that game.

To play the game, and know the rules, check out [Go Fish](https://cardgames.io/gofish/)



You've already created **Card** and **Card Deck** classes, and you'll be using them in this exercise.

Clone this Repo and let's get started.

You'll find 4 classes:

* Card
* Card Deck
* Player
* Go Fish



We're going to start out by implementing small helper methods that will assist us in this exercise. For each section, make sure all the tests are passing.

### Exercise 1

Create a method, that takes as input an array, and sorts it. 

### Exercise 2

Create a method, that takes as input a sorted array, and inserts an element into that array keeping it sorted.

### Exercise 3

Create a method that given a sorted array, searches for an element in that array.

### Exercise 4

We would like to shuffle a stack with the help of 2 other stacks. How would you do that? Think of how you shuffle a card deck.

### Exercise 5

Re-implement the card deck to use a stack instead of an array. Also add a to_s method which prints all elements in the deck. Finally alter the deal method to return the last n elements, with n having a default value of 1



Now we have our Card and Card Deck classes. Let's start implementing the game.

### Exercise 6

Open the Player class, and complete the missing code.

### Exercise 7

Open the Go Fish class, and complete the missing code.



Make sure all your tests are passing. To play the game, open the terminal and run your file from there:

ruby go_fish.rb
