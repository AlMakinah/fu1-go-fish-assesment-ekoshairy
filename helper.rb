# Exercise 1
# Create a method, that takes as input an array, and sorts it.
def sort_array(arr)
  # TODO: Complete Implementation
  # Check array#sort in the documentation
end

# Exercise 2
# Create a method, that takes as input a sorted array,
# and inserts an element into that array keeping it sorted.
def insert(arr, element)
  # TODO: Complete implementation
  # similar to sortArray, but simpler.. how?
end

# Exercise 3
# Create a method that given a sorted array, searches for an element in that
# array.
def search(arr, element)
  # simplest way, go through them until current element is larger than one
  # we're searching for.
end

# Exercise 4
# We would like to shuffle a stack with the help of 2 other stacks.
# How would you do that? Think of how you shuffle a card deck.
def shuffle_stack(mystack)
  # TODO: Complete Implementation
