# Exercise 1
# Create a method, that takes as input an array, and sorts it. 
def sortArray(arr)
  # TODO # insertion sort
  
end


# Exercise 2
# Create a method, that takes as input a sorted array, 
# and inserts an element into that array keeping it sorted.
def insert(arr, element)
  # TODO
  # similar to sortArray, but simpler.. how?
end



# Exercise 3
# Create a method that given a sorted array, searches for an element in that array.
def search(arr, element)
  # simplest way, go through them until current element is larger than one we're searching for.
end


# Exercise 4
# We would like to shuffle a stack with the help of 2 other stacks. 
# How would you do that? Think of how you shuffle a card deck.
def shuffleStack(mystack)
  # TODO
